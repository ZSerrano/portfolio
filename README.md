## Description
Created a portfolio site from scratch utilizing the acceptance criteria given in the Module 2 Challenge readme file. User will be able to click on pictures of deployed applications created by the portfolio owner to see those applications in action, as well as learn some general information about the owner.

## Process
- Created a header with name of portfolio owner and a responsive nav bar
- Created a subheader with room for a picture of the owner and a caption if wanted
- Created the body of the page and formatted it per the example photo given
- Populated the body of the page with titles corresponding to the different sections and content pertaining to those sections
- Attached ID's to the sections that are linked to the nav bar and allow the user to navigate through the page smoothly
- Populated the 'Work' section with images that are linked to the deployed website urls for the owner's applications
- Created a nav bar in the 'Contact' section that would hypothetically link to each piece of contact info as needed
